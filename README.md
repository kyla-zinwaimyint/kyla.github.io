## Projects Overview
### MetaHuman VR Research Project
#### Overview
+ **Genre**: Adventurous/ Educational VR game for Language Learning
+ **Platform**: Developed using Unreal Engine 5.4.2 (Blueprint)
  
**Description**: This is my very first game developed as a final project for my Game Development Course. This project is a first person atmospheric horror game
that immerses players in a chilling world where they are trapped until they find the hidden key. There are two levels, the Human World and the Parallel World. 
In Human World, the players have to find the key and avoid the hidden trigger areas which could lead them to the Parallel World. In Parallel World, there's a horrific creature 
that will find you and catch you. To escape, players must memorize the rooms that have trigger areas and find the key in the Human World. 

#### Key Features
+ **Memorization Mechanics**:
  + The game challenges players to memorize the locations of trigger areas throughout the environment, as each time they return from the Parallel World,
    the game restarts, requiring them to navigate their surroundings anew.
  + This adds an extra layer of gameplay complexity.
+ **Dynamic Enemy Encounters**:
  + Features a gripping animation where the enemy catches the player, lifting them by the neck and delivering a brutal strike, enhancing the horror experience and
    immersing players in the intensity of the chase.
+ **Enemy AI Setup**:
  + The enemy is equipped with AI that allows it to wander throughout the level, actively searching for and catching the player, creating unpredictable encounters
    that heighten tension.
+ **Atmospheric Design**:
  + Utilizes unsettling soundscrapes and visually haunting environment to create a tense atmosphere that keeps players on edge.

#### Future Updates
+ **Random Door Openings**:
  + Introduce a mechanic where doors randomly open based on the time the player spends wandering the level, adding an element of surprise and enhancing the horror experience.
+ **Enhanced Storyline and Immersive Design**:
  + Develop a more haunting narrative that deepens the lore and emotional impact of the game, alongside improvements to the overall immersive game design.
+ **Advanced Enemy AI**:
  + Implement a more sophisticated AI system that learns and adapts to the player's behavior, making enemy encounters more challenging and personalized,
    thus increasing replayability and tension.
